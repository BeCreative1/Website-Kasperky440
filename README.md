Project came through design part, developing part and deploying part. In design part we have learned how to use Figma more in depth. In development part, we wanted to challanges ourselves and use VUE.js. It was for us new technology and we were learning as we were going. VUE.js and it's technology Vue i18n was very helpful, when we implementing changing languages of the content. Vue also helped us with managing lifecycles and creating loading on the page. Vue was helpful, but at the same time most challanges and difficulties with which have encountered, where connected with this technology.
